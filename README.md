Kitchen-Pulumi is a collection of [Test-Kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) plugins for testing [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)-based cloud infrastructure projects
under the [test-driven infrastructure](https://www.arresteddevops.com/tdi/) paradigm.
With Kitchen-Pulumi you can provision ephemeral test stacks, verify they are in a desired state using [InSpec](https://www.inspec.io/), and tear them down to gain
confidence in your infrastructure code before it hits production.

## Features

Kitchen-Pulumi provides a Kitchen [driver](https://kitchen.ci/docs/drivers/), [provisioner](https://kitchen.ci/docs/provisioners/),
and [verifier](https://kitchen.ci/docs/verifiers/) which collectively support the following features:

* **Language-agnostic**: Create and test Pulumi stacks in any of their [supported languages](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/languages/).
* **Backend-agnostic**: Use the Pulumi SaaS backend, a local backend, or your organization's internal backend.
* **Configurable**: Easily define/override stack config values in your `.kitchen.yml` file for flexible testing across environments or scenarios.
* **Test changes over time**: Simulate changes in stack config values over time to test how your infrastructure reacts to ever-shifting user-provided values.
* **Custom state verification**: Code any validation logic you desire, provided it can be ran within an [InSpec profile](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).
