    stack_settings_hash?: >
      Invalid stack settings map - config/secrets maps should be a map of maps.
      The top-level map keys represent Pulumi namespaces on which the key-value pairs
      in that namespace's nested map are set.

    config_evolution_items_valid_types?: >
      Invalid stack evolution list - Stack evolutions must be a list whose map-type items contain at
      least one of three values --- 1. 'config_file' - String specifying path to config file to use for this update.
      2. 'config' - A map of maps in which the top-level map keys represent Pulumi namespaces on which the key-value pairs
      in that namespace's nested map are set. 3. 'secrets' -- A map with the same structure as 'config', but whose values
      will be set as secrets on your stack.
